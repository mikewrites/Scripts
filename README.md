# Scripts
Some simple python scripts I wrote to automate common tasks you'll need python 3 installed and I've only tested these on linux machines, I think they should work on Mac as well and some might run on windows


fester: simple script that creates a markdown file containing the contents of a specified directory, the file will be saved in the directory as manifest.md 
usage: fester <absolute filepath(you can use a ~)>
